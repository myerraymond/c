# c++
A collection of c++ code i have done.

- Justified text, evenly spreading out an inputted line of text over 40 characters with equal amount of spaces in between each word.

- Voltages, an input of voltages where an alogirthm which calculates what is 10% and 15% of all the voltages combined. Then sees if any of the voltages have a higher then 10% change and displays if any voltages have a higher then 15% voltage change.

- Calculating Dates, a simple calculator which uses a couple of simple alorithms to determine what date it would be from any date. The code also invovles, odd dates (28 day months & gap years).
