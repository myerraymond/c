# c++
A collection of c++ code i have done.

- Justified text, evenly spreading out an inputted line of text over 40 characters with equal amount of spaces in between each word.

- Voltages, an input of voltages where an alogirthm which calculates what is 10% and 15% of all the voltages combined. Then sees if any of the voltages have a higher then 10% change and displays if any voltages have a higher then 15% voltage change.

- Calculating Dates, a simple calculator which uses a couple of simple alorithms to determine what date it would be from any date. The code also invovles, odd dates (28 day months & gap years).

- Average Score, average score is a simple scoring program, which reads in the number of judges and then reads in the score that they have given. From this it finds the average of all the scores provided.

- Fibonacci Sequence, a simple program which displays the fibonacci sequence. To extend it more simply change the for loop (i < x).
